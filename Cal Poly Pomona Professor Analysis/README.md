# Cal Poly Pomona Professor Analysis
This project is aimed at analyzing Cal Poly Pomona professor reviews from the website Rate My Professors. The project is currently in progress, and the data for reviews has been successfully collected and stored. We are now in the process of gathering individual professor data, which will be linked to the reviews table for further analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized around two primary tables:

### Professors Table

This table will store the following data for each professor:

    Professor_ID: Unique identifier for each professor.
    Professor_Name: Full name of the Professor.
    Department: The department the professor belongs to
    Total_Reviews: Total number of reviews the professor has received.
    Avg_Rating: The average quality rating given to the professor (1.0-5.0).
    Would_Take_Again: The percentage of students who would take the professor again.
    Avg_Difficulty: The average difficulty rating of the professorâ€™s courses (1.0-5.0).

### Reviews Table

This table stores individual reviews, linked to each professor by the foreign key, Professor_ID :

### Tools Used

    RStudio
        RSelenium
        Tidyverse
        dplyr
    Microsoft SQL Server
    Excel
    Instant Data Scrapper
    Jupyter Notebook
        Pandas

### Data Collection

Data collection was primarily done with collaboration [Rodrigo Isidro](https://github.com/Rodgeroger). Data collection was done using two softwares. the first was Instant Data Scrapper for the professors table and RStudio for the reviews table. I used RSelenium and Tidyverse to gather and manipulate the data. Microsoft SQL will then be used for further analysis. R code used was originally written by Samer Hijjazi with minor modifications done by me. Original code is avaliable here. His Youtube video on how to setup RSelenium and video on his Ratemyprofessor project were a big help, along with his entire Youtube channel. For chromedriver troubles, ZeeCoding video was a huge help
