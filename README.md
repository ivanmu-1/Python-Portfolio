# Welcome to my Python Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of Python-based data science projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, and automation using tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

## Projects

### Cal Poly Pomona Professor Analysis

**Description:**  
A Python ETL project that performs web scraping using BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites, transforms the data with Pandas through cleaning, formatting, structuring, and exploratory visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib, and then writes the transformed data into an SQL script for further analysis and insight generation
