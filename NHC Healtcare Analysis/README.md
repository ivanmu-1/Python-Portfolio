# Healthcare Data Analysis Projects

This repository presents a series of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating core skills in healthcare data analysis using Python. These projects were developed as practical exercises in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, and forecasting to derive insights from real-world healthcare datasets.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Wrangling & Manipulation
- **Objective**: Clean and reformat a raw dataset of 1000 generic medication names into a structured format with medication name and class.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data cleaning and restructuring using pandas
  - Text parsing and transformation
  - Validation and organization of unstructured data

### 2. Pharmacy Sales Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze medication sales data to identify top-selling categories and predict future demand.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Exploratory data analysis and summary statistics
  - Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
  - Time-series forecasting with Prophet
  - Demand prediction and inventory planning insights

### 3. Patient Visit Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze hospital outpatient visit data to understand patient demographics, visit trends, and cost efficiency.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data preparation and cleaning
  - Demographic and trend analysis
  - Cost and insurance claim analysis
  - Operational efficiency review through treatment time and cost metrics

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preparation using Python
- Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics
- Visualization of healthcare costs and insurance trends
- Basic statistical modeling and time-series forecasting
- Use of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Prophet

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
