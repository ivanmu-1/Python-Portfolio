# Python Data Analysis for Healthcare

### Overview: 
The project focuses on analzying healtcare data, specifically exploring cost and insurance informatio nfrom a patient visit dataset. Through this prokect, I practiced data analysis tecchniques including:
* Data cleaning and preparation:
* Exploratory data analsyis
* Visalization of healtcare cost and insurance trend
* Basic statistical analysis using Python libraries Python libraries (Pandas, Mathplotlib, Seaborn)

### Goals
* Practice Python analysis kill
* Create visualziaiton to illustrate data distrubtion and relationship using tools
* Generate forceasts and trend using time-series analysis nad libraries such as Prophet, to predict future healthcare needs and resoruce utilization.
